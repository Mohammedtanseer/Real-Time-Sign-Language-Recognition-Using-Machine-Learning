# Real-Time-Sign-Language-Recognition-Using-Machine-Learning
ABSTRACT

Sign Language Recognition (SLR) systems have emerged as a breakthrough in facilitating communication between individuals with speech and hearing impairments and those without.The proposed method involves filtering the hand gesture and applying a classifier to predict the corresponding ASL fingerspelling class. The experimental results demonstrate a high accuracy of 95.7% for the recognition of the 26 letters of the alphabet. This approach provides a promising avenue for improving communication between deaf-mute individuals and the general population, leveraging the power of neural networks and image processing techniques.

STEPS OF BUILDING THE PROJECT

STEP 1 - Preparing and Cleaning Data Set

To prepare and clean the dataset, First we have read two CSV files containing sign language images and their corresponding labels, and we have stored them as Pandas Data Frames. Then we have extracted the labels from the Data Frame and stored them separately in the labelâ€™s variable.
